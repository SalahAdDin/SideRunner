# SideRunner
A side scroll runner made on Unreal Engine 4 following the [Free3dee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1Ejvwm3HnQ&list=PL4AluGdTlI1pwDWGwTny5LDVeyjjhijwq) tutorial.

The concept is very simple: you are the rock and you have to jump over each platform avoiding the obstacles.

This repository has two versions: [C++](https://github.com/SalahAdDin/SideRunner/tree/c++) and [Blueprint](https://github.com/SalahAdDin/SideRunner/tree/blueprint).

Feel free to make pull request and issues.
